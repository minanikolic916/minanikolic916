# Hello, I'm Mina! 👋

## 👨‍💻📚 About Me

I'm a teaching associate and master's student, passionate about Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Database concepts. 🚀

## 📚 Learning & Growing

Currently, my reasearch area is focused around the field of Explainable AI, Large Language Models, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Vector Databases. 

## 🛠 Projects

Here are a few projects I've been working with recently:

- Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems by combining the Question Answering capabilities of Large Language Models with Vector Stores
- The Experimental Evaluation of different XAI techiques for LLMs using Token-wise interpretability
- Visual Programming support for XAI
- Transfer Learning for image classification with CNNs (VGG19) and XAI libraries
- Advanced feature selection for Machine Learning models
- Implementing a XAI pipeline in order to demystify decision made by various LLMs in the field of text classification
